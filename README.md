## 🔍 Featured Project: Loan Approval Prediction
[Loan Approval Prediction Repository](https://github.com/ariazand/loan-approval-prediction)

As of now, there are gaps in the way many banks and financial institutions handle loan approval processes. Traditional systems often lack transparency, consistency, and the ability to adapt to nuanced applicant profiles. Our goal is to develop an AI-powered loan approval model that can assess client data and predict whether or not an applicant is likely to be approved, based on multiple financial and personal criteria.

  This paper introduces a type of neural network that is easier to understand and more in line with financial regulations. It helped shape our thinking on how explainable AI can be used in credit scoring models, especially when trust and fairness are key.
