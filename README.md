## Loan Approval Prediction Model
[Loan Approval Prediction Repository](https://github.com/ariazand/loan-approval-prediction)

As of now, there are gaps in the way many banks and financial institutions handle loan approval processes. Traditional systems often lack transparency, consistency, and the ability to adapt to nuanced applicant profiles. Our goal is to develop an AI-powered loan approval model that can assess client data and predict whether or not an applicant is likely to be approved, based on multiple financial and personal criteria.

## 🌐 [Live Web Demo](https://your-vibe-coding-link.com)
Built using Vibe Coding

Our live web demo allows users to interact with a simplified version of our loan approval prediction system.

👉 How it works:

    The front-end form, built using Google Apps Script, lets users input various details commonly used in loan evaluations (e.g., income, credit history, education, loan amount, etc.).

    When submitted, the information is passed to a backend system powered by a trained supervised machine learning model.

    The backend evaluates the applicant’s profile using the model and returns a prediction—indicating whether the applicant is likely to be approved for a loan.

    This setup showcases how AI can provide **real-time**, **accessible predictions** to assist financial decision-making.

This prototype is an early example of how financial institutions could integrate explainable and ethical AI into loan decision processes, improving both **efficiency** and **user trust**.

💡 Why This Project?

As Generative AI becomes more prevalent in our lives, the need for institutions to adapt and incorporate it continues to grow. Financial institutions, in particular, are seeing the benefits of using AI to streamline various aspects of the business. Our project focuses on financial service companies, like banks, and the development of AI-powered systems that assist in loan decision-making with greater accuracy, speed, and transparency. We were inspired by the paper “Monotonic Neural Additive Models: Pursuing Regulated Machine Learning Models for Credit Scoring”, submitted to the International Conference on AI in Finance 2022.

We aimed to leverage a machine learning model on a loan dataset from Kaggle to evaluate client profiles more holistically and recognize patterns across financial, educational, and demographic data. This project serves as a prototype for how financial institutions can integrate AI tools to better serve clients and communities.

The project was developed with three main components: a Python machine learning model, a front-end interface, and a back-end system with AI assistance. The goal was to create an AI-powered loan approval system, consisting of:

    A front-end interface where customers fill out a questionnaire.

    A back-end system that processes the data through an AI model for analysis.

    An administrative dashboard that describes the steps and findings.

I. Planning

We planned the project in four phases:

    Data Collection: Collect customer loan application data via a front-end interface.

    Data Storage: Store the data in a structured format using Google Sheets.

    Data Analysis: Analyze the data using a trained machine learning model.

    Display Results: Show insights and results via an administrative dashboard.

II. Front-End Interface

The front-end interface was designed as a web-based questionnaire to collect customer data related to loans and personal details. Once submitted, the data is instantly sent to a Google Sheets page for analysis. This functionality was implemented using Google Apps Script and HTML, ensuring reliable data transfer.

## 🔮 What’s Next: Future Development & Responsible AI

As AI continues to reshape financial decision-making, our project aims to grow in a direction that balances innovation with responsibility. Here are the top 5 areas we’re focusing on for future improvement:

1. **Model Refinement with Fairness in Mind**  
   We plan to improve model performance by testing more advanced supervised algorithms while actively monitoring and mitigating bias.

2. **Transparency & Explainability**  
   As financial decisions impact real lives, we will continue using different artificial intelligence tools in order to make our predictions interpretable and trustworthy.

3. **Deployment Experience**  
   We want to upgrade from our initial demo to a polished full-stack web app or dashboard, making loan prediction more interactive and user-friendly.

4. **Data Privacy & Security**  
   Protecting sensitive financial information is extremely important. Our team will explore techniques for secure storage and responsible data handling throughout the ML pipeline.

5. **Human Oversight & Accountability**  
   Our decision framework will keep humans in the loop and offers transparency in case reviews or applicant appeals.
