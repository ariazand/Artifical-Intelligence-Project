## Loan Approval Prediction Model
[Loan Approval Prediction Repository](https://github.com/ariazand/loan-approval-prediction)

As of now, there are gaps in the way many banks and financial institutions handle loan approval processes. Traditional systems often lack transparency, consistency, and the ability to adapt to nuanced applicant profiles. Our goal is to develop an AI-powered loan approval model that can assess client data and predict whether or not an applicant is likely to be approved, based on multiple financial and personal criteria.

## 🌐 [Live Web Demo](https://your-vibe-coding-link.com)
Built using Vibe Coding

Our live web demo allows users to interact with a simplified version of our loan approval prediction system.

👉 How it works:

    The front-end form, built using Google Apps Script, lets users input various details commonly used in loan evaluations (e.g., income, credit history, education, loan amount, etc.).

    When submitted, the information is passed to a backend system powered by a trained supervised machine learning model.

    The backend evaluates the applicant’s profile using the model and returns a prediction—indicating whether the applicant is likely to be approved for a loan.

    This setup showcases how AI can provide **real-time**, **accessible predictions** to assist financial decision-making.

This prototype is an early example of how financial institutions could integrate explainable and ethical AI into loan decision processes, improving both **efficiency** and **user trust**.

  This paper introduces a type of neural network that is easier to understand and more in line with financial regulations. It helped shape our thinking on how explainable AI can be used in credit scoring models, especially when trust and fairness are key.

## 🔮 What’s Next: Future Development & Responsible AI

As AI continues to reshape financial decision-making, our project aims to grow in a direction that balances innovation with responsibility. Here are the top 5 areas we’re focusing on for future improvement:

1. **Model Refinement with Fairness in Mind**  
   We plan to improve model performance by testing more advanced supervised algorithms while actively monitoring and mitigating bias.

2. **Transparency & Explainability**  
   As financial decisions impact real lives, we will continue using different artificial intelligence tools in order to make our predictions interpretable and trustworthy.

3. **Deployment Experience**  
   We want to upgrade from our initial demo to a polished full-stack web app or dashboard, making loan prediction more interactive and user-friendly.

4. **Data Privacy & Security**  
   Protecting sensitive financial information is extremely important. Our team will explore techniques for secure storage and responsible data handling throughout the ML pipeline.

5. **Human Oversight & Accountability**  
   Our decision framework will keep humans in the loop and offers transparency in case reviews or applicant appeals.
